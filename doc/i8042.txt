Note the difference between "keyboard controller" and "keyboard-controller":
While former refers to, literally, the keyboard controller, latter stands
for the sending/receiving done between keyboard and keyboard controller.

Since we are only communicating with the keyboard controller, we do not
need to know anything about the communication going on between keyboard
and keyboard controller.
The Intel 8042 exchanges data with the system through three internal
registers: status, input, and output registers.
NOTE: unless explicitly mentioned, all registers, buffers, etc. refer to the
Intel 8042 controller.
The responsible part of the system for keyboard interaction can be
visualized as such:

                              Keyboard
                                 ^
                                 |
                                 v
                         Keyboard Controller
          (input buffer)  (status register) (output buffer)
                ^                |                 |
                |                v                 v
      0x60 write-0x64 write  0x64 read         0x60 read
---------------------------------------------------------------
                             System

"System" simply refers to to the system except the keyboard and the keyboard
controller.
The input buffer stores commands and data sent from the system to the
keyboard controller.
The output buffer is used to deliver data to the system as requested
by a command or in shape of a scancode.
The status register contains some status information about the controller.


Reading from one of the buffers empties it simultaneously. In conclusion,
the bit indicating that the input buffer is full implies that the keyboard
controller has not read the buffer yet. Furthermore, the bit indicating
that the output buffer is full implies that the system has not read
the buffer yet.
