The bootloader is loaded to physical address `0x7c00' by the BIOS.
It loads the secondary bootloader in turn, which in turn loads the kernel.
The secondary bootloader is loaded right below the EBDA, whose addresses is
contained in the BDA and obtained from there by the primary bootloader.
The kernel is located in the memory from `0x0' to the start of the secondary
bootloader. Dynamic data structures can be allocated everywhere else, including
high memory above 1 MiB.
