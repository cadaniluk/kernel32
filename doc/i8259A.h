The IR number goes under several different names.
I've heard so far "type," "code," and "level," so don't get all too confused
when reading datasheets and this code.

Since there can be multiple PICs in the machine, we cannot write the
driver explicitly for just one controller with one set of ports and all.
To support multiple PICs we distinguish them using the I/O base address
(usually `0x20' for master and `0xa0' for slave) and pass these base
addresses to the functions.

TODO: I HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD YET WHAT THE A0 PIN IS FOR IN THE i8259A.

FOR MY QUESTIONS. I NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT TO REALLY WRITE A GOOD DRIVER!
SO DO IT! FIGURE IT OUT! ASAP!!!

The Intel 8259A can be used together with the 8086 (and therefore the x86
line, since all x86 processors are backward-compatible to the 8086) and the
MCS-80 and MCS-85 processors, which constitute some other Intel processor
line. Those MCS processors are of no interest to us, though. That means that
the Intel 8259 driver files describe the x86 line only.

# REGISTERS (WORTH MENTIONING): #
#################################

IMR (Interrupt Mask Register); 8-bit:
When the controller receives an interrupt, the IMR is checked first. If
the corresponding bit is cleared the interrupt is allowed. If set, it is
"masked off," thus making the controller discard it.

IRR (Interrupt Request Register); 8-bit:
One for every interrupt line (bit 0: IR0, bit 1: IR1, ...,
bit 7: IR7). A set bit indicates an interrupt request.

ISR (In-Service Register); 8-bit:
After interrupt requests have been received in the IRR, the priority
resolver figures out which one has the highest priority. The
highest priority one has its IRR bit cleared and its ISR bit set in order to
indicate it is being serviced.

# CASCADING: #
##############

Multiple Intel 8259A chips can be "cascaded," i.e., they can be tied
together, so that more than just eight IRs can be handled as with just a
single controller. In cascading mode, there is one "master" PIC, the others
are so-called "slave" PICs. The slaves' #INT line is connected to the
IR lines of the master. They can issue interrupts and acknowledge them
just like the master controller. The master uses the CAS0 - CAS2 lines to
send a #CS (chip select) signal to the slave, so the IR code can be put
on the data bus.

# INTERRUPT SEQUENCE: #
#######################

1. Interrupt request (IR) lines are raised, corresponding bits in the IRR are
   set.
2. The controller evaluates the requests, checks the IMR, if not masked off,
   sets the appropriate bit in the IRR, and raises the #INT line to the CPU.
2. The controller evaluates the requests, checks the IMR, if not masked off,
   sets the appropriate bit in the IRR, and raises the #INT line to the CPU.
3. The CPU acknowledges the #INT and raises the #INTA line in return.
4. If the raised #INTA is processed, the highest priority interrupt request
   is determined (over the priority resolver) and the appropriate bits of
   that IR are cleared/set in the IRR and ISR. All lower-priority interrupts
   are inhibited while the ISR bit is set. For information on
   higher-priority interrupts, read NOTE 2.
5. The CPU raises the #INTA line again and the controller sends an 8-bit
   pointer with the interrupt code in return.
6. AEOI (automatic EOI) mode: the ISR bit is cleared.
   EOI (end of interrupt) mode: the ISR bit remains set until the
   appropriate EOI command is issued by the CPU, that is, by the interrupt
   handler.
NOTE 1: if the IR could not be detected anymore at step 4 (because the IR's
duration was too short), IR7 will be assumed (spurious interrupt). On a
spurious interrupt, a default interrupt will be issued: the IR7 handler will
be executed but the ISR bit will not be set. If a normal IR7 interrupt
is fired, the ISR bit is set, though. However, if a default IR7 interrupt
is fired during a normal IR7 handler, the ISR bit will stay set for
the default IR7 interrupt as well. Code for detection of spurious interrupts
needs to pay attention to this quirk.
NOTE 2: if a higher priority IR occurs between the first and second #INTA
signals, the #INT line goes inactive right after the second #INTA raise and
after an UNSPECIFIED time period, the #INT goes active again to
signalize the higher priority IR.


##################
# ICWS AND OCWS: #
##################

A sequence of Initialization Control Words (ICWs) is used to initialize
each of the PICs in the system (there may be several, cascaded ones,
remember). In fact, the sequence consists of 2 - 4 ICWs.
Operation Control Words (OCWs) determine the interrupt mode the controller
operates in. The following modes are eligible for selection:
- Fully nested mode
- Rotating priority mode
- Special mask mode
- Polled mode
OCWs can be sent to the controller anytime after initialization thereof.


For the difference between edge-triggered and level-triggered modes, view
this link:
http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/21886/ \
what-does-edge-triggered-and-level-triggered-mean (3/29/16)
My understanding:
Both modes make some circuit become active.
Edge-triggered mode activates it when the signal is at the edge from
low to high or high to low.
Level-triggered mode activates it when the signal is at a certain level. On
this controller, the "level" is reached when the signal is raised high.
