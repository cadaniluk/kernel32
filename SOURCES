This file contains all resources I used for gathering information about OSes,
kernels, drivers, and whatever necessary to write this software. Not that I am
afraid of any lawsuits or something because I pilfered intellectual property
(if that is possible in this case at all); I just want to keep track of the
resources to

- give, in fact, credit to the people who taught me.
- resolve any misconceptions about kernels etc. when bumping into this project.
- prevent arguments about the correctness of the software. For instance,
  someone pretends an `int' can be eight bits wide. A quick look at the C11
  standard (or draft if, like me, you cannot afford a true copy) contradicts
  that.

Sources:

NOTE: if a source is not explicitly mentioned in any file of the project
except this one, it served as a source for general or indirect information
that was only part of the trail to the final result, the actual code.

First off, I want to praise Stack Overflow, the flagship of the Stack Exchange
network and the #1 website for programming questions on the Internet. It
helped/helps me with my questions and answered most of them in a satisfactory
manner and let me gather much experience, be it by asking or answering
questions myself.
Stack Overflow was the first (and is, as of March 28, 2016, the only)
programming website I contributed to significantly. I have currently approx.
9.4k reputation, which cost me a lot of dedication and concentration. But that
was definitely worth the effort because I gained a humongous pile of
experience using the site and my understanding of computers expanded therein
as well.
I started contributing to some German programming forums as well, although
a rarity that I actually posted something. Those forums employ a different
format of communication, called a thread. It has this name because the
conversation is composed of many, small messages, not one comprehensive question
and one comprehensive answer. I noticed that those small messages contain
prevalently "bad stuff," such as questions due to the asker's impreciseness,
mocking, and insults, but occasionally even answering. It is absolutely
inaccessible to future readers and the superflous comments and unconcrete
questions distract from the actual question's content. Stack Overflow is way
better in that regard and just better from virtually every perspective. Also,
English is the lingua franca of computer scientists, programmers, and other
IT folks, so Stack Overflow is better suited for programming anyway. German
computer forums suffer from a lack of population anyway.
Before I write a whole essay, let's wrap this up into one conclusion:
Stack Overflow is superior. All others are inferior. Stack Overflow
is not perfect, definitely not, but it is the best out there, I am pretty
confident it is.
