 * send a #CS (chip select) signal to the slave, so the IR code can be put

/* #######################
 * # INTERRUPT SEQUENCE: #
 * ####################### */

/* 1. Interrupt request (IR) lines are raised, corresponding bits in the IRR are
 *    set.
 * 2. The controller evaluates the requests, checks the IMR, if not masked off,
 *    sets the appropriate bit in the IRR, and raises the #INT line to the CPU.
 * 3. The CPU acknowledges the #INT and raises the #INTA line in return.
 * 4. If the raised #INTA is processed, the highest priority interrupt request
 *    is determined (over the priority resolver) and the appropriate bits of
 *    that IR are cleared/set in the IRR and ISR. All lower-priority interrupts
 *    are inhibited while the ISR bit is set. For information on
 *    higher-priority interrupts, read NOTE 2.
 * 5. The CPU raises the #INTA line again and the controller sends an 8-bit
 *    pointer with the interrupt code in return.
 * 6. AEOI (automatic EOI) mode: the ISR bit is cleared.
 *    EOI (end of interrupt) mode: the ISR bit remains set until the
 *    appropriate EOI command is issued by the CPU, that is, by the interrupt
 *    handler.
 * NOTE 1: if the IR could not be detected anymore at step 4 (because the IR's
 * duration was too short), IR7 will be assumed (spurious interrupt). On a
 * spurious interrupt, a default interrupt will be issued: the IR7 handler will
 * be executed but the ISR bit will not be set. If a normal IR7 interrupt
 * is fired, the ISR bit is set, though. However, if a default IR7 interrupt
 * is fired during a normal IR7 handler, the ISR bit will stay set for
 * the default IR7 interrupt as well. Code for detection of spurious interrupts
 * needs to pay attention to this quirk.
 * NOTE 2: if a higher priority IR occurs between the first and second #INTA
 * signals, the #INT line goes inactive right after the second #INTA raise and
 * after an UNSPECIFIED time period, the #INT goes active again to
 * signalize the higher priority IR.
