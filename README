Overall Description

This is the `README` file of my custom kernel and bootloader, all merged
into one project. It aims to be a POSIX-compliant (this may take decades to
accomplish, though) kernel, which can run at least GNU user space programs.
Moreover, that should be guaranteed through POSIX compliance.
Naturally, this project utilizes the GNU toolchain, including GCC, as, make,
ld, (perhaps) m4, objdump, objcopy, and more I cannot think of right now.

Rules

1. The GNU as directive `.set` and similar directives are avoided. Use the
  C preprocessor instead. Optionally, yet another preprocessor like GNU m4 can
  be used.
2. Setters are called `setxxx`. Getters are called `xxx`.
3. Header files are divided into sections for the assembler and for the
  compiler. Code only for the assembler is surrounded by a `#if __ASSEMBLER__
  == 1 ... #endif` macro pair, code only for the compiler is embraced by a `#if
  __ASSEMBLER__ != 1 ... #endif` macro pair, and code for both is free of
  conditional macros of that kind. `__ASSEMBLER__` is a standard predefined
  macro
4. All code is C11-compliant. Mainly to support variable definitions within
  for-loops and use the wonderful `static_assert` feature.
5. Use macros instead of `enum`s to retain compatibility to assembly code.
  This particular rule might be argued about but I'm prepared for any
  counter argument.
6. The number of columns of a source file is limited to 80.
7. One indentation level amounts to one tab (with preferably eight spaces).

Parts

The whole project is split into two parts: the part responsible for booting
and the actual kernel. These two parts are to be kept split; do not create
dependencies between those, only clean interfaces.

The booting part includes the first-stage bootloader and the booting system,
which basically prepares the load of the kernel into memory and its final
execution: they determine data (memory size, hardware available, etc.), load the
corresponding next stage (and eventually the kernel), move I/O-mapped memory,
program controllers, and whatever. It is written in assembler because GCC
currently does not support real 16-bit code; it just emits 32-bit and adds size
override prefixes, which gets really lengthy, especially in a 512-byte-confined
bootloader. 

The kernel is, well, the kernel. A thorough description is given spread across
all source files (TODO: which is to be summarized to one `/doc` directory
containing detailed documentation of all parts of the project), so I can omit
describing it here myself in good conscience and delegate that task to said
resources.

Directories

These are the directories and the fields they are supposed to cover.

`/`:
The root directory. It contains all other directories and configuration
files, linker scripts, make files, and other files, which concern the
the project as a whole.

`/include`:
Header files for interaction with drivers and other interfaces
necessary for writing kernel code like synchronization primitives, debugging
utility, and numerous other things. 
Many (if not all) header files described in here have a corresponding
implementation, so, for example, the driver interfaces in `/include/drivers`
have their implementations in `/drivers`. Remember that when looking for
certain files. 

`/include/drivers`:
Header files for drivers. 

`/include/drivers/pci`:
Drivers for devices intended for attachment to the PCI (Peripheral Component
Interconnect) bus. The bus is the current standard for normal PCs with some
optional extensions like PCI Express.     

`/include/drivers/isa`:
Drivers for devices intended for attachment to the (legacy) ISA (Industry
Standard Architecture) bus. The devices originate back from the IBM PC, PC XT, 
and PC AT days.

`/drivers`:
Implementations of drivers for all the devices and the like the
kernel needs to interact with. "and the like" implies that, strictly speaking,
not only devices are kept in there: an APM driver, an ACPI driver, etc. are also
supposed to be rooted in that directory.

`/tools`:
Name shamelessly copied from the Linux kernel (I don't think the GPL (current
Linux license) disallows it, so, no copyright, no guilty conscience). It
contains scripts/programs that help managing, building, and developing the
project.
